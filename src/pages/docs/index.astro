      <h2>ðŸš€ What's the deal?</h2>
      <p>
        Look, we get it. You want components that just work without installing
        half the internet. That's why we keep it simple: grab what you need,
        paste it in your project, and ship it. No package management therapy
        needed!
      </p>

      <h2>âœ¨ Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Zero dependencies (because who needs the baggage?)</li>
        <li>Just Astro + Tailwind (keeping it pure and simple)</li>
        <li>Copy & paste friendly (like your favorite memes)</li>
        <li>Dark mode included (for your late-night coding sessions)</li>
      </ul>
